              <h2>Group submissions</h2>
              <p>We created an app called "smArt" which provides a revolutionary digital service that will help our customers explore their creative preferences by searching for similar art or artists in their area by using photo recognition technology and recommendations of museums where they can find it.</p>
                <p>smArtâ€™s core idea is to provide the user with a tool in which he is able to find the type of art he likes whether it is in a museum or an exposition. The app makes it possible for the user to snap a picture of the work of art he admires and instantly find similar artists, artworks or art auctions in his area.</p>

              <h2>Individual work</h2>
              <p>This theme was the most complex one out of all of them. Working in a group for 4 weeks led to a development in my communication and teamwork skills.</p>
              <p>My main task was to code the website prototype and create the XD prototype, but almost everything we did was due to good teamwork. We all brainstormed and did the research necessary for our service to work.</p>
              <p>The website is a landing page which has the purpose of converting traffic into app downloads and therefore increase the usage of the app. It also shows and explains our features so the user will have an idea of what the app is doing before downloading and using it.</p>
