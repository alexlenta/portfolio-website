            <h1>ABOUT THE STYLE</h1>
            <h2>General</h2>
            <p class="typography_text"><b>Art Nouveau</b> is an international style of art, architecture and applied art, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1890 and 1910. A reaction to the academic art of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.</p>
            <p class="typography_text">The emphasis on linear contours took precedence over color, which was usually represented with hues such as muted greens, browns, yellows, and blues. </p>
            <p class="typography_text"><b>Art Nouveau</b> is a total art style&#58; It embraces a wide range of fine and decorative arts, including architecture, painting, graphic art, interior design, jewelry, furniture, textiles, ceramics, glass art, and metal work.</p>
            <p class="typography_text">By 1910, <b>Art Nouveau</b> was already out of style. It was replaced as the dominant European architectural and decorative style first by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco" title="Art Deco Wiki" target="_blank">Art Deco</a> and then by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism" title="Modernism Wiki" target="_blank">Modernism</a>.</p>

                <p class="typography_text">When Hector Guimard was commissioned to design these famous subway station entrances, Paris was only the second city in the world (after London) to have constructed an underground railway.<br>Guimard's design answered the desire to celebrate and promote this new infrastructure with a bold structure that would be clearly visible on the Paris streetscape.<br>The entrances use the twisted, organic forms typical of <b>Art Nouveau</b> that appear at first to be nearly seamless, yet they are constructed out of several cast iron parts. </p>

            <h1> Alphonse Mucha </h1>
            <img src="images/large/Alfons_Mucha_800px.png" class="imgSize500" alt="alfons">
            <p class="typography_text">Alphonse Mucha, was a Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist, known best for his distinct style. He produced many paintings, illustrations, advertisements, postcards, and designs.</p>
            <p class="typography_text">Mucha produced a flurry of paintings, posters, advertisements, and book illustrations, as well as designs for jewelry, carpets, wallpaper, and theatre sets in what was termed initially The Mucha Style but became known as <b>Art Nouveau</b> (French for "new art").</p>
            <p class="typography_text"> Mucha's works frequently featured beautiful young women in flowing, vaguely Neoclassical-looking robes, often surrounded by lush flowers which sometimes formed halos behind their heads. In contrast with contemporary poster makers he used pale pastel colors.</p>
